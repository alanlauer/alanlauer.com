I've felt like I've been plateaued on the drums for a while. I did make some real progress during the pandemic when I set up a huge drum set, but I still struggle with some things. This article will be an ever growing list of practice strategies, tips and tricks, areas to focus on, and other things I've found helpful in improving my drum (or just feeling better about it).

Here's an interesting video: [5 Reasons Youâ€™re Still an Intermediate Drummer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UvijtZQo4&list=WL&index=1) by [The 80/20 Drummer](https://www.youtube.com/@8020drummer)

## Here are the Areas he mentions to work on:

### Subdivisions
Notes should fall on the matrix -- quarter notes should be a quarter of the measure long, eigths should be an eigth of the measure long... and tempo needs to be consistent. This is extra important for linear playing. You can vary this for various feels, but consistent subdivisions are a good foundation.

### Zones
Play your drums in the center consistently. Play rimshots consistently. Be able to reproduce a sound consistently. Know where certain good sounds come from and be able to get to those places consistently.

### Stick Height
Ghost notes should be an inch above the drum. Accents should be a foot above the drum. They should sound very different, and you should be able to control how different they sound.

### Voicing
Develop control over the volume of each drum independently. Vary those volumes based on the genre or the part of the song... and be able to not vary it if needed.

### Macrotime
Develop the ability to maintain a consistent tempo from the beginning of a song to the end. Develop the ability to feel the "correct" metronomic pulse even when your playing is varying the time -- stretching and compressing.

## How to Practice These Things

### Building skills...

1. Paradiddles with accents. - Subdivisions/Stick Height
2. Add orchestration. - Stick Height/Zones/Voicing
3. Play a basic beat. - Voicing
4. Play a linear hand beat. - All
5. Add the kick. - All

### Let's incorporate Macrotime...

7. Play a beat with the metronome on 16ths.
8. Try a switching (roll) beat.
9. Try a linear beat.
10. Move the metronome to offbeat 8ths or 16ths. (This forces you to create the time and the metronome checks you.)
11. Progress toward just having the metronome on beat 4. This is a Macrotime test.

## Some additional things to add:

Control Your Emotions
Maintain control of each area when you're excited... or don't get excited.

Don't flam. Be able not to flam.
