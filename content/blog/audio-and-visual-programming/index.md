...and apparently *expression pedal inputs are kind of CV???*

...a great and simple ESP32 walkie talkie project:

...and this is the audio programming guy I like talking about the JS library I couldn't remember, tone.js (I know you said you don't like ECMA, but I still think this is interesting):

Also, I found a C++ library for audio programming:
https://juce.com/ ... but I was unable to find good examples of anyone using this with an ESP32 to make an effects pedal or anything similar.
