Since the start of the pandemic, I've been kicked out of four bands...

- Astro Alloy
  - _2020-10-01 - 2020-11-30_
  - a few practices and many feedback sessions on the band and sound after I was replaced
  - "I've found a wild young drummer who has never been in a band and who wants to practice every day."

- Last Ride In
  - _2020-12-09 - 2021-02-10_
  - 3 practices... felt like more
  - "We decided to go with an old friend."

- Rad Gnar
  - *2022-02-10 - 2023-08-27*
  - ~60 practices, countless strategy discussions, and an EP
  - "You aren't committed enough."

- Death Party
  - _2024-01-21 - 2024-02-23_
  - "I found someone more permanent."

I'm still kind of reeling from all of this. Like am I not a great drummer? LOL

It's caused me to spend some time thinking about my shortcomings as a musician and a person...

1. I over-commit. I don't think I should be in more than one band.
2. I'm undisciplined -- I don't practice alone often.
3. I struggle to learn songs... I don't have a standard method.
4. When I start working with a band, I need to clarify what we all want and our expectations.
