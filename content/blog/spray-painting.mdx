* Minimize wind
* Temps between 65 and 85
* Humidity below 40%
* Build a spray booth - tall, stable, lit well, sealable, ventilated (negative pressure)
* Clean out the dust from the booth between jobs/colors
* Hang your pieces so you can spin them, but think about reaching the top and bottom
* Overspray is a bitch -- consider it and get out of the way!
* Sand
* Prime
* Shake
* Use thinner coats than you think!
* More coats is better than thicker coats
* If not smooth, clean between coats
* Shake while painting
* Fluid strokes
* Double final drying time to fully cure
* Read and exceed the instructions
* Spin the piece
* Clean with mineral spirits before painting
* All coats within one hour!
* Surface should be smooth after each coat of primer and paint
* Hanging is best; triangles can scratch your fresh paint
* Microfiber cloth
* Remove all rust, mill scale, oil with a grinder
* CLEAN THE SURFACE BEFORE STARTING by any means necessary
* After painting, clear the nozzle by spraying upside down
