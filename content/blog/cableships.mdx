### Activists and Cableships

I used to work for eBay as a MIM for their backbone network -- they have a semi-global network of leased circuits that their corporate and "ebay.com" networks ride upon... kinda like another vendor between those business units and the circuit providers from which the logical circuits are leased.
 
Anyway, fiber cuts were our day-in, day-out. I can think of two interesting scenarios...
 
One was when the ... climate-? anti-technology-? ... activists were repeatedly cutting or shot-gunning transcontinental fibers in the California desert. And they would strategically pick the ones that were on railroad easements. So then the fiber company would have to coordinate with the railroad to STOP TRAINS before they could go in and fix them out in the middle of nowhere.
 
And the other interesting scenario is when the trans-oceanic fibers ([⁠map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/)) are cut. The ⁠[cable layer ships](https://globalmarine.co.uk/vessels-trenching-assets/) they use to fix these cuts are fascinating. They have a [gigantic spool of fiber](https://www.vanoord.com/en/equipment/cable-laying-equipment/) on them, and often carry a submersible. And you can [track the ships](LINK-NEEDED). Sometimes those cables are down for a looooooong time, like [this one in Tonga that was down for 18 months due to a volcanic eruption](https://subtelforum.com/tonga-cable-fixed-18-months-post-eruption/)... We used to get status emails saying that the ship would arrive at the cable in 10 days, 8 days, 5 days – ship has been diverted due to weather – 14 days, 10 days – incoming hurricane. It would go on and on like that LOL
